In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. 
The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess:
"Pico" when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, 
"Fermi" when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, 
and "Bagels" if your guess has no correct digits. You have 3 tries to guess the secret number.

# ----- simple/barebones soulition -------

# come up with three digit number
answer_digit = 123

# provide user a hint
clues = 'the secret three digit number is in the movie title of a john travolta film\nthe three digitis are sequential'

# ask the user for an input
user_guess = input('enter your guess for the three digit number: ')

# if the answer is not correct, provide a user a hint, and reask the user for an input, up to three times
'''
i need to check if a user input is in the correct place, relative to answer digit place
if the digit is not in the correct place, is it present at all in the answer
if it is not, then the hint must be 'bagel
the hint must be sequential - first fermi, then pico, then bagel
if i only provide one hint per guess, what takes precident when a user input has a right digit, right place
and right digit, wrong place - this quesiton is relevant when the correct answer has repeating digits
for simple soulition, lets just provide hints for each digit

hints_per_digit = ''

# chatgpt fixed my for loop to include i, and enumrate - as enumrate get the index (i) and the value of digit

for i, digit in enumerate(str(user_guess)):
    if digit == str(answer_digit)[i]:
        hints_per_digit += 'Fermi '
    elif digit in str(answer_digit):
        hints_per_digit += 'Pico '
    else:
        hints_per_digit += 'Bagel '

print('your answer produced the following hints: ',hints_per_digit)
