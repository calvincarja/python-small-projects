-- instructions --

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. 
The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess:
"Pico" when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, 
"Fermi" when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, 
and "Bagels" if your guess has no correct digits. You have 3 tries to guess the secret number.
